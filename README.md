Setup of CS260 startup project

Edit #2 in Github
HaHaGit and VSC!

From this assignment I learned how to better navigate VSCode and GitHub and how they can sync together. I still do not feel completely comfortable with it, but I now understand where the push, pull, and commit buttons are, and I am learning how to read the error messages in VSCode. This was very helpful to me.
