Setup of CS260 startup project

Edit #2 in Github
HaHaGit and VSC!

From this assignment I learned how to better navigate VSCode and GitHub and how they can sync together. I still do not feel completely comfortable with it, but I now understand where the push, pull, and commit buttons are, and I am learning how to read the error messages in VSCode. This was very helpful to me.

Simon Project Notes: I learned the format of html and how the text will automatically indent after opening a bracket (<main>) and will de-indent when you close it (</main>). I also discovered how easy it is to add hyperlinks to a website. The commits were good for me to keep track of where I was in the project and why I made certain changes.

CSS: remember that any defined element can be treated as its own entity!

CSS rescaling: I am most familiar with CSS Flexbox, but there is also grid and responsive design. These are for rescaling a website to fit certain dimensions (like portrait vs landscape on a phone).

For using CSS, remember to add the styleguide link on the HTML document! Look up styles you aren't familiar with, and use my simon as reference. I've learned that CSS is not that hard, but there are so many options it is near impossible to keep track of them all. But google is a friend and will help me know what color codes are for what colors and how to get the design I want.

From making my startup project with HTML and CSS, I learned a lot more about how they function both separately and together. I learned how to change specific elements in CSS and how to make a form. I also solidified how to link pages together. It was super tricky to get my recipe images to line up side by side but I figured it out, thanks to columns and rows.
