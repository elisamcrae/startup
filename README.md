HaHaGit and VSC!

From this assignment I learned how to better navigate VSCode and GitHub and how they can sync together. I still do not feel completely comfortable with it, but I now understand where the push, pull, and commit buttons are, and I am learning how to read the error messages in VSCode. This was very helpful to me.

Simon Project Notes: I learned the format of html and how the text will automatically indent after opening a bracket (<main>) and will de-indent when you close it (</main>). I also discovered how easy it is to add hyperlinks to a website. The commits were good for me to keep track of where I was in the project and why I made certain changes.

CSS: remember that any defined element can be treated as its own entity!

CSS rescaling: I am most familiar with CSS Flexbox, but there is also grid and responsive design. These are for rescaling a website to fit certain dimensions (like portrait vs landscape on a phone).

For using CSS, remember to add the styleguide link on the HTML document! Look up styles you aren't familiar with, and use my simon as reference. I've learned that CSS is not that hard, but there are so many options it is near impossible to keep track of them all. But google is a friend and will help me know what color codes are for what colors and how to get the design I want.

From making my startup project with HTML and CSS, I learned a lot more about how they function both separately and together. I learned how to change specific elements in CSS and how to make a form. I also solidified how to link pages together. It was super tricky to get my recipe images to line up side by side but I figured it out, thanks to columns and rows.

With the Simon JS, I learned that it is important to make sure you call the JS functions in the HTML file. I also learned the hard to way to make sure that the audio files (or any other called files) are named what you think they are.

MIDTERM:

You CAN use this to load CSS fonts from google: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Quicksand');

flex-direction: column-reverse; will make the columns start at the bottom and go up (ex. "world", "hello") just put the words in separate divs

CSS padding: puts space around the content of selected elements

This adds 1 to y: const f = y => ++y; console.log(f(3))
Other arrow functions: Reduce - takes an array and reduces it to one value
Maps - takes an array and puts it in an array of equal size with each value mapped to something else

DIV: division element

Pals butter mannonaise - (content), padding, border, margin - order of CSS box model from inside out

let b = a.filter(v => v.match(/A|f/i)); regex that matches A and f (but case insensitive)

document.querySelector('p').addEventListener('mouseover', console.log): adds a mouseover event listener to a p element

HTML tag for unordered list: ul
ordered list: ol
list: li

Valid JS functions: const f = (x) => {}
function f(x) {}
const f = function(x) {}

To include JS in HTML:
<script>1+1</script>
<script src='main.js' />
<div onclick='1+1' />

JS objects look like this: "{ n:1 }"

DOM textContent properties sets the child text for an element

TO create an HTML hyperlink: <a href='https://c.com'>x</a>

div.header { color: blue; } when class=header will turn the text blue

{"x":3} valid JSON; single quotes and undefineds are not

chmod +x deploy.sh makes a script executable

THE INTERNET:
The internet globally connects independent networks and computing devices. In a simplistic way, you can think of the internet as a massive redundant collection of wires that connect up all the computers in the world. A lot of those wires are wireless (wiFi, satellite, or cell), and not all of computers in the world are connected, but generally that is what the internet is. The deeper your mental model of the internet is, the more effectively you will be able to create web applications.

Internet connections

Making connections
When one device wants to talk to another it must have an IP address. For example, 128.187.16.184 is BYU's address. Usually, human users prefer a symbolic name over an IP address. The symbolic name is called a domain name. Domain names are converted to IP address by doing a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS). You can look up the IP address for any domain name using the dig console utility.

➜  dig byu.edu

byu.edu.		5755	IN	A	128.187.16.184
Internet requests

Once you have the IP address, you connect to the device it represents by first asking for a connection route to the device. A connection route consists of many hops across the network until the destination is dynamically discovered and the connection established. With the connection the transport and application layers start exchanging data.

Traceroute
You can determine the hops in a connection using the traceroute console utility. In the following example, we trace the route between a home computer and BYU. In the result you see the first address 192.168.1.1. This is the address of the network router the home computer is connected to. From there it goes through a couple devices that do not identify themselves and then hits the Google Fiber gateway. Google Fiber is the internet service provider, or ISP, for the requesting device. Then we jump through a few more unidentified devices before finally arriving at BYU (128.187.16.184).

➜  traceroute byu.edu

traceroute to byu.edu (128.187.16.184), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
 1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  10.942 ms  4.055 ms  4.694 ms
 2  * * *
 3  * * *
 4  192-119-18-212.mci.googlefiber.net (192.119.18.212)  5.369 ms  5.576 ms  6.456 ms
 5  216.21.171.197 (216.21.171.197)  6.283 ms  6.767 ms  5.532 ms
 6  * * *
 7  * * *
 8  * * *
 9  byu.com (128.187.16.184)  7.544 ms !X *  40.231 ms !X
If I run traceroute again I might see a slightly different route since every connection through the internet is dynamically calculated. The ability to discover a route makes the internet resilient when network devices fail or disappear from the network.

Network internals
The actual sending of data across the internet uses the TCP/IP model. This is a layered architecture that covers everything from the physical wires to the data that a web application sends. At the top of the TCP/IP protocol is the application layer. It represents user functionality, such as the web (HTTP), mail (SMTP), files (FTP), remote shell (SSH), and chat (IRC). Underneath that is the transport layer which breaks the application layer's information into small chunks and sends the data. The actual connection is made using the internet layer. This finds the device you want to talk to and keeps the connection alive. Finally, at the bottom of the model is the link layer which deals with the physical connections and hardware.

TCP/IP layers
Layer	Example	Purpose
Application	HTTPS	Functionality like web browsing
Transport	TCP	Moving connection information packets
Internet	IP	Establishing connections
Link	Fiber, hardware	Physical connections

WEB SERVERS:
A web server is a computing device that is hosting a web service that knows how to accept incoming internet connections and speak the HTTP application protocol.

Monolithic web servers
In the early days of web programming, you would buy a massive, complex, expensive, software program that spoke HTTP and installed on a hardware server. The package of server and software was considered the web server because the web service software was the only thing running on the server.

When Berners-Lee wrote his first web server it only served up static HTML files. This soon advanced so that they allowed dynamic functionality, including the ability to generate all the HTML on demand in response to a users interaction. That facilitated what we now know as modern web applications.

Combining web and application services
Today, most modern programming languages include libraries that provide the ability to make connections and serve up HTTP. For example, here is a simple Go language program that is a fully functioning web service. Later on in the course we will show how this is done with JavaScript.

package main

import (
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// Serve up files found in the public_html directory
	fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public_html"))
	http.Handle("/", fs)

	// Listen for HTTP requests
	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil)
}
Being able to easily create web services makes it easy to completely drop the monolithic web server concept and just build web services right into your web application. With our simple go example we can add a function that responds with the current time, when the /api/time resource is requested.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func getTime(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, time.Now().String())
}

func main() {
	// Serve up files found in the public_html directory
	fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public_html"))
	http.Handle("/", fs)

	// Dynamically provide data
	http.HandleFunc("/api/time", getTime)

	// Listen for HTTP requests
	fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil))
}
We can run that web service code, and use the console application Curl to make an HTTP request and see the time response.

➜  curl localhost:3000/api/time

Web service gateways
Since it is so easy to build web services it is common to find multiple web services running on the same computing device. The trick is exposing the multiple services in a way that a connection can be made to each of them. Every network device allows for separate network connections by referring to a unique port number. Each service on the device starts up on a different port. In the example above, the go web service was using port 80. So you could just have a user access each service by referring to the port it was launched on. However, this makes it difficult for the user of the services to remember what port matches to which service. To resolve this we introduce a service gateway, or sometimes called a reverse proxy, that is itself a simple web service that listens on the common HTTP port 443. The gateway then looks at the request and maps it to the other services running on a different ports.

Gateway

Our web server will use the application Caddy as the gateway to our services. The details of how Caddy works will be given later.

Microservices
Web services that provide a single functional purpose are referred to as microservices. By partitioning functionality into small logical chucks, you can develop and manage them independently from other functionality in a larger system. They can also handle large fluctuations in user demand by simply running more and more stateless copies of the microservice from multiple virtual servers hosted in a dynamic cloud environment. For example, one microservice for generating your genealogical family tree might be able to handle 1,000 users concurrently. So in order to support 1 million users, you just deploy 1,000 instances of the service running on scalable virtual hardware.

Serverless
The idea of microservices naturally evolved into the world of serverless functionality where the server is conceptually removed from the architecture and you just write a function that speaks HTTP. That function is loaded through an gateway that maps a web request to the function. The gateway automatically scales the hardware needed to host the serverless function based on demand. This reduces what the web application developer needs to think about down to a single independent function.

DOMAIN NAMES:
A domain name is simply a text string that follows a specific naming convention and is listed in a special database called the domain name registry.

Domain names are broken up into a root domain, with one or more possible subdomain prefixes. The root domain is represented by a secondary level domain and a top level domain. The top level domain (TLD) represent things like com, edu, or click. So a root domain would look something like byu.edu, google.com, or cs260.click. The possible list of TLDs is controlled by ICANN, one of the governing boards of the internet.

Domain name parts

The owner of a root domain can create any number of subdomains off the root domain. Each subdomain may resolve to a different IP address. So the owner of cs260.click can have subdomains for travel (travel.cs260.click), finance (finance.cs260.click), or a blog (blog.cs260.click).

You can get information about a domain name from the domain name registry using the whois console utility.

Once a domain name is in the registry it can be listed with a domain name system (DNS) server and associated with an IP address. Of course you must also lease the IP address before you can use it to uniquely identify a device on the internet, but that is a topic for another time. Every DNS server in the world references a few special DNS servers that are considered the authoritative name servers for associating a domain name with an IP address.

The DNS database records that facilitate the mapping of domain names to IP addresses come in several flavors. The main ones we are concerned with are the address (A) and the canonical name (CNAME) records. An A record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A CNAME record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map byu.com to the same IP address as byu.edu so that either one could be used.

When you enter a domain name into a browser, the browser first checks to see if it has the name already in its cache of names. If it does not, it contacts a DNS server and gets the IP address. The DNS server also keeps a cache of names. If the domain name is not in the cache, it will request the name from an authoritative name server. If the authority does not know the name then you get an unknown domain name error. If the process does resolve, then the browser makes the HTTP connection to the associated IP address.

As you can see, there is a lot of levels of name caching. This is done for performance reasons, but it also can be frustrating when you are trying to update the information associated with your domain name. This is where the time to live (TTL) setting for a domain record comes into play. You can set this to be something short like 5 minutes or as long as several days. The different caching layers should then honor the TTL and clear their cache after the requested period has passed.

CADDY:
Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service. This ability to route requests is called a gateway, or reverse proxy, and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service (i.e. Caddy).

For this course, we use Caddy for the following reasons.

Caddy handles all of the creation and rotation of web certificates. This allows us to easily support HTTPS.
Caddy serves up all of your static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. All of your early application work will be hosted as static files.
Caddy acts as a gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and start up application services. For example, when a request is made to simon.yourdomain Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) provides the foundational content structure that all web applications build on. HTML was originally designed to be a publishing format for web documents, or pages. From that original definition web programmers have morphed the web page concept into a web application where a page now represents either a single page application (SPA) or a large group of hyperlinked pages that form a multi-page application (MPA). By itself HTML is amazing, but to create a full web application we will need other technologies to style (CSS) our pages and make them interactive (JavaScript). For now, we will focus on creating the content structure with HTML.

Here is an example of a simple HTML document.

Hello world
The first thing you noticed is that this looks like a simple text document. That is because text is valid HTML. In order to provide structure to our text we need to introduce the concept of elements and their associated tag representation.

Elements and tags
HTML elements are represented with enclosing tags that may enclose other elements or text. For example, the paragraph element, and its associated tag (p), designate that the text is a structural paragraph of text. When we talk about tags we are referring to a delimited textual name that we use to designate the start and end of an HTML element as it appears in an HTML document. Tags are delimited with the less than (<) and greater than (>) symbols. A closing tag will also have a forward slash (/) before its name.

<p>Hello world</p>
We can continue adding structure to the page with additional elements. Each of these elements may contain other elements that provide the structure of our web page. The html element represents the top level page structure. The head element contains metadata about the page and the page title. The body element represents the content structure. The main element represents the main content structure, as opposed to things like headers, footers, asides, and navigation content. These additional elements result in the following HTML page.

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
However, when we render the HTML in a browser it would look exactly the same as our original simple text example. The reason for that is that HTML is almost completely about structure. The visual appearance of the web page won't really change until we start styling the page with CSS.

HTML Hello world

Attributes
Every HTML element may have attributes. Attributes describe the specific details of the element. For example, the id attribute gives a unique ID to the element so that you can distinguish it from other elements. The class attribute is another common element attribute that designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements. Attributes are written inside the element tag with a name followed by an optional value. You can use either single quotes (') or double quotes (") to delimit attribute values.

<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
Hyperlinks
One of the core features that made the web so successful was the ability to create hyperlinks that take you from one page to another another with a simple click. A hyperlink in HTML is represented with an anchor (a) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). A hyperlink to BYU's home page looks like this:

<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
Complete example
HTML defines a header (<!DOCTYPE html>) that tells the browser the type and version of the document. You should always include this at the top of the HTML file. We can now add the header, some attributes, and more content to our document for a full example.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <p class="introduction">
        HTML welcomes you to the amazing world of
        <span class="topic">web programming</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What will this mean to you?</p>
      <p class="assignment">Learn more <a href="instruction.html">here</a>.</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
Intro HTML Example

Notice that the rendered document has almost no styling. That is because the entire purpose of HTML is to provide content and structure. The layout of the content is left almost entirely up to Cascading Stylesheets (CSS). When styling was introduced with CSS, all of the HTML elements that defined style such as font, strike, and plaintext were deprecated.

Common elements
Modern HTML contains over 100 different elements. Here is a short list of HTML elements that you will commonly see.

element	meaning
html	The page container
head	Header information
title	Title of the page
meta	Metadata for the page such as character set or viewport settings
script	JavaScript reference. Either a external reference, or inline
include	External content reference
body	The entire content body of the page
header	Header of the main content
footer	Footer of the main content
nav	Navigational inputs
main	Main content of the page
section	A section of the main content
aside	Aside content from the main content
div	A block division of content
span	An inline span of content
h<1-9>	Text heading. From h1, the highest level, down to h9, the lowest level
p	A paragraph of text
b	Bring attention
table	Table
tr	Table row
th	Table header
td	Table data
ol,ul	Ordered or unordered list
li	List item
a	Anchor the text to a hyperlink
img	Graphical image reference
dialog	Interactive component such as a confirmation
form	A collection of user input
input	User input field
audio	Audio content
video	Video content
svg	Scalable vector graphic content
iframe	Inline frame of another HTML page
Comments
You can include comments in your HTML files by starting the comment with <!-- and ending it with -->. Any text withing a comment block will be completely ignored when the browser renders it.

<!-- commented text -->
Special characters
HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the entity syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (<) you would instead use the less than entity (&lt;). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

Character	Entity
&	&amp;
<	&lt;
>	&gt;
"	&quot;
'	&apos;
😀	&#128512;
HTML Versions
Understanding when different HTML features were introduced helps you know what has been around for a long time and probably supported by all browsers, and what is new and may not work everywhere. HTML is pretty stable, but it is still good to check a website like MDN or canIUse to make sure.

Year	Version	Features
1990	HTML1	format tags
1995	HTML2	tables, internationalization
1997	HTML3	MathML, CSS, frame tags
1999	HTML4	external CSS
2014	HTML5	email, password, media, and semantic tags
index.html
By default a web server will display the HTML file named index.html when a web browser, such as Google Chrome, makes a request without asking for a specific HTML file. For example, when you ask for https://google.com in your web browser you will actually get back the HTML for the file https://google.com/index.html. For this reason, it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application index.html.

Rendering HTML
You can save any HTML file to your computer's disk and then open the file using your browser. You can also open the HTML file in VS Code and use the Live Server extension to display the HTML. Another way to easily play with HTML is to use a sandbox like CodePen. However, when you use CodePen it is not necessary to supply the HTML DocType header or the root html element since CodePen already assumes you are providing HTML. Here is our example HTML document rendered in CodePen.

CodePen HTML introduction

The two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to your web application. Some of the common HTML structural elements include body, header, footer, main, section aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top level content body. The body has three children, a header, main, and footer. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.

The header contains a paragraph with a span, and a navigation containing multiple divisions of sub-content.

The main contains multiple sections that contain either an unordered list (ul) or a table. Main also contains an aside for content that does not fit the content flow of the sections.

The footer has a content division with a single span.

<body>
  <p>Body</p>
  <header>
    <p>Header - <span>Span</span></p>
    <nav>
      Navigation
      <div>Div</div>
      <div>Div</div>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>
    <aside>
      <p>Aside</p>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <div>Footer - <span>Span</span></div>
  </footer>
</body>
If we rendered this HTML, and added just a bit of styling, so we can see how they related to each other, we would see the following.

HTML structure

Properly representing the page structure using the elements is important not only so it makes logical sense to a programmer, but also so that automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.

Block and inline
There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element div (division) could have an inline element b in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a p (paragraph) element could have a span to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

<div>He said <b>don't</b> cross the beams.</div>

<p>
  Authors such as <span>ee cummings</span> often used unconventional structure.
</p>

From the very early days of HTML it contained elements for accepting the input of user data. These elements include the following:

Element	Meaning	Example
form	Input container and submission	<form action="form.html" method="post">
fieldset	Labeled input grouping	<fieldset> ... </fieldset>
input	Multiple types of user input	<input type="" />
select	Selection dropdown	<select><option>1</option></select>
optgroup	Grouped selection dropdown	<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>
option	Selection option	<option selected>option2</option>
textarea	Multiline text input	<textarea></textarea>
label	Individual input label	<label for="range">Range: </label>
output	Output of input	<output for="range">0</output>
meter	Display value with a known range	<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>
Form element
The main purpose of the form element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the form container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. With JavaScript we have much more control over input data and what is done with it. For example, in a single page application the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction. With this ability the data may not even be sent to the server. This greatly reduces the necessity of the form element, but it is often still used simply as a container. Just remember that you are not required to have a form element to use input elements.

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a textarea element.

<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's name attribute with the current value of the textarea.

ta-id=Some+text
Input element
The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the type attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

Type	Meaning
text	Single line textual value
password	Obscured password
email	Email address
tel	Telephone number
url	URL address
number	Numerical value
checkbox	Inclusive selection
radio	Exclusive selection
range	Range limited number
date	Year, month, day
datetime-local	Date and time
month	Year, month
week	Week of year
color	Color
file	Local file
submit	button to trigger form submission
In order to create an input you specify the desired type attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label>
<input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

Attribute	Meaning
name	The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form
disabled	Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input
value	The initial value of the input
required	Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid
The following shows what the inputs look like when rendered. Don't worry about how clunky they look right out of the box. We will fix that when we start styling things with CSS.

HTML Input

Validating input
Several of the input elements have validation built into them. This means that they will not accept a value that is not for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address. You can also specify the required attribute on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted. The pattern attribute exists on text, search, url, tel, email, and password inputs. When present, the pattern attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid.

You should also have validation built into your JavaScript that checks input data to ensures everything is valid before it is submitted. All of the input elements support functions for determining their validation state. Additionally, there are CSS style selectors for visualizing the validity of the input. In order to have a good user experience, it is critical that you provide sufficient user feedback early in the input process. A good design will give feedback as, or before, the user begins to input. A poor design will keep the user guessing as to why the data is not being accepted, or even if it was accepted.
	
The HTML elements that represent media include img, audio, video, svg, and canvas. The img, audio, and video elements are all simple references to an external file, but svg and canvas both contain the code for render a visual image that can even be animated.

External MEDIA:
The media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute. The path represented by the URL can either be a relative path or full path. A full path includes the protocol, domain name, and path to the file.

https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg
A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element. You want to make the path is as relative as possible so that you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references. For example, if your HTML page is located in a directory with a subdirectory named images that contains a file named photo.jpg you would use a relative path as follows.

images/photo.jpg
Image
To include an image in your content you use the img element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source image. In order to support accessibility, you should also include an alt attribute that describes the image. A full img element would look like the following.

<img
  alt="mountain landscape"
  src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg"
/>
mountain landscape

Audio
To include an audio file in your content you use the audio element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source image. You can include the controls attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The autoplay attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the loop attribute keeps it playing over and over.

⚠ Note that automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless you provide a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior.

<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
Html Audio

Video
To include a video in your content you use the video element and specify the src attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the controls or autoplay attributes

⚠ Note that you may need to include the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.

<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source
    src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"
  />
</video>
HTML video

Internal media
The internal media elements svg and canvas allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:

<svg
  viewBox="0 0 300 200"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  stroke="red"
  fill="red"
  style="border: 1px solid #000000"
>
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
</svg>
SVG demo

When combined with JavaScript and CSS you can produce some amazing visualizations. Checkout this CodePen for an example.

Consult the MDN documentation if you are interested in learning more about SVG.

Canvas
The canvas element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.

<canvas
  id="canvasDemo"
  width="300"
  height="200"
  style="border: 1px solid #000000"
></canvas>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</script>

CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) converts the structure and content of HTML into a vibrant, responsive, experience. The initial objective of CSS was to simply style the HTML based upon the desires of the user, developer, and browser. In modern web applications CSS styling focuses more on helping the developer create complex renderings of dynamic content that is responsive to the actions of the user and the device the application is rendered on. With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.

Functionally, CSS is primarily concerned with defining rulesets, or simply a rules. A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.

CSS definitions

For example, consider the following rule.

p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a san-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.

CSS simple rule

Associating CSS with HTML
There are three ways that you can associate CSS with HTML. The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.

<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
styles.css

p {
  color: green;
}
All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the link element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

Cascading styles
Because elements inherit the rules applied to their parents you often end up with the same declaration property applied to a single element multiple times. For example, we might set color property for all body elements to be red, and then paragraph elements to be green, and then span elements to be blue, and finally use a style element on a specific span to be black.

<body>
  <p><span style="color:black">CSS</span></p>
</body>
body {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: green;
}
span {
  color: blue;
}
In this case, the rules cascade down from the highest nodes in the DOM tree to the lowest level. Any declaration property defined at a lower level will override the higher declaration. You can see this happening if you use the browser's debugger. In Chrome right click on the element and select inspect. You can then click on each element in the debugger and see what the value of the color property is. For the case defined above you will see that each of the higher level declarations is crossed out until you get to the style explicitly defined on the element.

CSS cascade

The box model
CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.

CSS box model

By default, the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box. You can change the box-sizing CSS property from the default value of content-box to border-box in order to redefine the width and height to also include the padding and the border. This often makes it easier to style elements when their visual size matches their actual size.

CSS Versions
As with HTML, CSS has evolved significantly over the years. The following version table gives you an idea of when certain features were added and therefore how stable the support for them are.

Year	Version	Features
1996	CSS1	selectors, font, color, background, alignment, margin, border, padding
1998	CSS2	positioning, z-index, bidirectional text, shadows
2011	CSS2.1	removed incompatible features
1999-2021	CSS3	enhancements for media, box, background, borders, color, template, multi-column, selectors
Beginning with CSS3 the specification was divided into modules so that they could be implemented at different levels of maturity. Whether these modules will culminate in a CSS4 specification has not yet been decided.
	
SELECTORS:
	The first step in understanding CSS is mastering how to select the elements that a CSS rule applies to. The CSS rule selector can take many forms. In order to explain the most common selectors we need some demonstration HTML. Let's image a simple document describing the departments in a university. In our case we have a physics and a chemistry department. The information provided is very sparse, but the structure provided by the HTML is enough to work with.

<body>
  <h1>Departments</h1>
  <p>welcome message</p>
  <section id="physics">
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
</body>
By default every browser defines a base set of styles that it applies to all HTML. This varies slightly from browser to browser, but for the most part our document would render like this using the base browser styles.

CSS selectors base

We would like to style our document so that it looks like this when we are done.

CSS selectors final

Element type selector
To start things off, we want to make all elements in the document use a sans-serif font. We can do this by using an element name selector. By selecting the body element we will cascade our declaration down to all the children of the body, which is the whole document.

body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
Note that we could also use the wildcard element name selector (*) to select all elements, but for our needs the body element will work just fine.

We can also use element name selectors to give a bottom border to the top level heading (h1), as well as modify the section elements to pop out with a gray background and some white space in the padding and margins.

h1 {
  border-bottom: thin black solid;
}

section {
  background: #eeeeee;
  padding: 0.25em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}
Combinators
Next we want to change the color of the second level headings (h2), but we only want to do that within the sections for each department. To make that happen we can provide a descendant combinator that is defined with a space delimited list of values where each item in the list is a descendant of the previous item. So our selector would be all h2 elements that are descendants of section elements.

section h2 {
  color: #004400;
}
There are other types of combinators that you can use. These include the following.

Combinator	Meaning	Example	Description
Descendant	A list of descendants	body section	Any section that is a descendant of a body
Child	A list of direct children	section > p	Any p that is a direct child of a section
General sibling	A list of siblings	p ~ div	Any p that has a div sibling
Adjacent sibling	A list of adjacent sibling	p + div	Any p that has an adjacent div sibling
We can use the general sibling combinator to increase the whitespace padding on the left of paragraphs that are siblings of a level two heading.

h2 ~ p {
  padding-left: 0.5em;
}
Class selector
The next selector we will use is the class selector. Remember that any element can have zero or more classification applied to it. For example, our document has a class of introduction applied to the first paragraph, and a class of summary applied to the final paragraph of each section. If we want to bold the summary paragraphs we would supply the class name summary prefixed with a period (.summary).

.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
You can also combine the element name and class selectors to select all paragraphs with a class of summary.

p.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
ID selector
ID selectors reference the ID of an element. All IDs should be unique within an HTML document and so this select targets a specific element. To use the ID selector you prefix the ID with the hash symbol (#). We would like to showcase our physics department by putting a thin purple border along the left side of the physics section.

#physics {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
Attribute selector
Attribute selectors allow you to select elements based upon their attributes. You use an attribute selector to select any element with a given attribute (a[href]). You can also specify a required value for an attribute (a[href="./fish.png"]) in order for the selector to match. Attribute selectors also support wildcards such as the ability to select attribute values containing specific text (`p[href*="https://"]).

p[class='summary'] {
  color: red;
}
For a full description of attribute selections refer to MDN.

Pseudo selector
CSS also defines a significant list of pseudo selectors which select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes. We will give just one example. Suppose we what our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.

section:hover {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
You can find out more about pseudo selectors on MDN.
	
DECLARATIONS:
CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are legions of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. For our purposes we will discuss just a few of the more commonly used ones so that you can get a feel for wide variety of functionality they represent.

Units
📖 Suggested reading: MDN Values and units

You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, a the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (px) or inches (in). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (50%), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (25vmin), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (1.5rem) as defined by the root element.

p {
  width: 25%;
  height: 30vh;
}
Here is a list of the most commonly used units. All of the units are prefixed with a number when used as a property value.

Unit	Description
px	The number of pixels
pt	The number of points (1/72 of an inch)
in	The number of inches
cm	The number of centimeters
%	A percentage of the parent element
em	A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the parent's font
rem	A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the root's font
ex	A multiplier of the height of the element's font
vw	A percentage of the viewport's width
vh	A percentage of the viewport's height
vmin	A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension
vmax	A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension
Color
📖 Suggested reading: MDN Applying color

CSS defines multiple ways to describe color, ranging from representations familiar to programmers and ones familiar to layout designers and artists.

Method	Example	Description
keyword	red	A set of predefined colors (e.g. white, cornflowerblue, darkslateblue)
RGB hex	#00FFAA22 or #0FA2	Red, green, and blue as a hexadecimal number, with an optional alpha opacity
RGB function	rbg(50%, 255, 128, 0.5)	Red, green, and blue as a percentage or number between 0 and 255, with an optional alpha opacity percentage
HSL	hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)	Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365 degree color wheel (red is 0 and 255). Saturation is how gray the color is, and light is how bright the color is.
	
FONTS:
Choosing appropriate fonts is a key web application design characteristic. A beautiful modern font will make your application enjoyable to use. Picking a hard to read font, an overused font, or using too many fonts will turn users away.

The CSS font-family property defines what fonts should be used. The property value represents an ordered list of fonts. The first font in the list that is available will be used. This ability to select from a list of fonts is important because different operating systems have different default fonts and your first choice may not be available.

Font families
There are four major families of fonts: Serif, san-serif, fixed, and symbol. A serif is a small stroke attached to the ends of a character's major strokes. Serif fonts have the extra strokes, san-serif fonts do not. Fixed fonts characters all are the same size. This is useful for lining up text when doing things like coding or display tabular data. Symbol fonts represent non-language characters such as arrows or emojis.

Importing fonts
In addition to referencing standard fonts found on the user's computer you can specify a font that you provide with your application. That way your application is guaranteed to always look the same. In order to have the browser load a font you use the @font-face rule and provide the font name and source location.

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.woff2');
}

p {
  font-family: Quicksand;
}
If you do not want to host font files on your server, then you can load them from a font provider. For example, Google provides a large selection of open source fonts that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate the CSS for importing the font.

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

p {
  font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
}
	
ANIMATION:
Using CSS to animate your components is an easy way to make your application feel alive and interactive. You create CSS animations using the animation properties and defining keyframes for what the element should look like a different times in the animation. Let's walk through an example.

We have a paragraph of centered text and we want it to zoom in until its size is 20% of the view height.

p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;
}
To make this happen we specify that we are animating the selected elements by adding the animation-name property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the keyframes that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence. We also add an animation-duration property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.

p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;

  animation-name: demo;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We don't have to define what happens at every millisecond of the animation. Instead we only need to define the key points and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another. In our case we simply want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords from and to.

@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
That's every thing we need to do. However, let's made one more addition. It would look better if towards the end, the paragraph bounce out a little bigger than its final size. We can accommodate that by adding another key frame that happens 95 percent through the animation.

@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  95% {
    font-size: 21vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
CSS animation

You can see this animation working with this CodePen.

Animation is not just for pushing buttons or making text float around. Here is an example of animating a watch using only HTML and CSS.

CodePen has a lot of CSS animation examples that you can experiment with. Here is a simple one with floating clouds that I found interesting. If you find an interesting one share it with us on Discord.
