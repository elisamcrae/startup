Setup of CS260 startup project

Edit #2 in Github
HaHaGit and VSC!

From this assignment I learned how to better navigate VSCode and GitHub and how they can sync together. I still do not feel completely comfortable with it, but I now understand where the push, pull, and commit buttons are, and I am learning how to read the error messages in VSCode. This was very helpful to me.

ELEVATOR PITCH:
Have you ever had a hard time deciding who gets to go first in a game? Perhaps you have even got into fights over it before the game ever started? This website will be a game-changer. Simply input the players names and click to determine who will be the first player. The computer will randomly select one person, who's name will be listed. If you are not happy with the selection, no problem! Just click the determination button again and another player will be generated.

KEY FEATURES:

*Ability to input each player's name

*Randomly selects a player from the list

*Can be repeated with each click of the button

*Players can be removed

*Displays currently registered players
